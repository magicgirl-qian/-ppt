<div class="answer"> <p>4764-1-25RE AID: 124</p> <p> RID: 175 | 3/13/12</p> <p> </p> <p>The matrix <i>A</i> is written as the product of the upper triangular matrix and its transpose.</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/816/8164360d-a89a-4cab-b348-f633a8a82c08/4764-1-25re-i1.png" /> </p> <p>Applying the determinant on both sides, we get <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/b10/b1062826-1caa-44c5-b196-93e6fc99c435/4764-1-25re-i2.png" /> by the properties of determinants.</p> <p>While <i>L</i> and its transpose are triangular matrices, their respective determinants are nothing but the product of the respective diagonals.</p> <p>So, <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/1d4/1d492685-8c16-4f98-afd6-39f869d3b33a/4764-1-25re-i3.png" /></p> <p>While the determinant of <i>A</i> is not zero, we can say that <i>A</i> is non singular and so invertible. …… (1)</p> </div>

Outside this band all entries are zero.</p> <p>In our case, the diagonal entries are 1, 5, and 26 which are all not zero and so condition one satisfied.</p> <p>The adjacent diagonals have the entries 2, 5 and 2, 12 which are also not zero.</p> <p>Condition two is satisfied.</p> <p>Other entries are in the places 1, 3 and 3, 1 which are both zeroes.</p> <p>So, condition three is satisfied.</p> <p>Therefore, the matrix <i>A</i> is tridiagonal. …… (3)</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The pivot entries are obtained by reducing the matrix to lower triangular matrix using row operations.</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/91f/91fc57bf-930e-496f-bb4a-468510dda158/4764-1-25re-i5.png" /> </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/697/6970cc28-4d66-4047-9fce-80c2ad069437/4764-1-25re-i6.png" /> </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/ef8/ef8e41b7-dc7a-4931-81f4-4a803630bfd2/4764-1-25re-i7.png" /> </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/b1d/b1d04589-e9f3-4cc8-9df8-7e52d718a564/4764-1-25re-i8.png" /> </p> <p>Therefore, the pivot entries are 1, 1, and 1. …… (4)</p> <p> In the above course of reduction, we noted that 12 times the row 2 is subtracted from row 3 to make the 3, 2 entry zero. …… (5) </p></div>
