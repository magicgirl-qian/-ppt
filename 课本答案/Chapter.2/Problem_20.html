<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Let <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> be any two <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/450/4502f4e3-9ae3-48d5-bcbb-9604467fda9e/4764-2-20RE-i3.png" style="width: 24pt; height: 14.25pt" />permutation matrices.</p> <p>Consider<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/ba7/ba72ec92-4895-4eb3-b4dd-852058b30bb8/4764-2-20RE-i4.png" style="width: 63.75pt; height: 15.75pt" />, where 0 is the zero matrix.</p> <p>Thus, the matrix <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/c88/c88bdaaa-cd15-490d-b171-dd020901e8dd/4764-2-20RE-i5.png" style="width: 47.25pt; height: 15.75pt" />has each entry 0. Now <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/0d4/0d411b14-a30d-44d0-abb2-3051c63f8c50/4764-2-20RE-i6.png" style="width: 20.25pt; height: 14.25pt" />can be thought of as the matrix, obtained from <i>A</i> by replacing each 1 by <i /> and keeping 0's as they are. Similarly, <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/a5a/a5a161be-e3ed-4ec1-b6af-6ae71a41871c/4764-2-20RE-i7.png" style="width: 20.25pt; height: 15.75pt" />can be thought of as the matrix, obtained from <i>B</i> by replacing each 1 by <i /> and keeping 0's as they are.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>It is clear that<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/6bd/6bdcbe75-60aa-4fda-86fd-07308212f7a3/4764-2-20RE-i8.png" style="width: 36.75pt; height: 18.75pt" />, for some <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>. </p> <p>Therefore, if not both <i /> and <i /> are zero, then <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/15e/15ec72e7-3276-47c8-9248-f68c46a0ef05/4764-2-20RE-i9.png" style="width: 65.25pt; height: 15.75pt" />.</p> <p>Therefore, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are linearly independent matrices. But <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are any two matrices. Therefore, all the matrices are linearly independent.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>These 120 matrices do not span the space of all 5 by 5 matrices. </p> <p>To understand this, let us show that the following matrix <i>A</i> cannot be expressed as any linear combination of these 120 matrices.</p> <p> </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/a13/a13ba0df-33af-4e34-985b-5801639a66c5/4764-2-20RE-i10.png" style="width: 108.75pt; height: 90pt" /></p> <p>If we want to write <i>A</i> as a linear combination of some of the 120 matrices, it is obvious that one of the matrices must have the entry in the first row and first column as 1. But the inclusion of such a matrix will have entry 1 in each of the 5 rows. When we try to cancel these 1's by having another matrix, multiplied by –1, this adds –1 somewhere. This process goes on and on.</p> <p>Thus, by no way it is possible to express <i>A</i> as a linear combination of any of the 120 matrices. </p></div>
