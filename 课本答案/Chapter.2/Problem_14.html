<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>We know that the dimension of the vector space <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/4b9/4b92b025-0d07-4da6-85e2-eb1ab3a0f5e3/4764-2-14re-i1.png" />is 3</p> <p>So, any three vectors in <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/430/43071cb6-20d2-419e-811c-f9edb73ae9ff/4764-2-14re-i2.png" />can form a basis provided they are linearly independent.</p> <p>A set of vectors is linearly independent if the vectors considered as columns form a square matrix with determinant not zero. </p> <p>Now, the vectors (1, 1, 3) , (2, 3, 6), and (1, 4, 3) are considered as columns of <i>A</i>, then the determinant of <i>A</i> is <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/727/727b0c92-023c-405d-b4c2-9f30c0af51ca/4764-2-14re-i3.png" /></p> <p>So, (1, 1, 3), (2, 3, 6), and (1, 4, 3) do not form a basis to <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/ce4/ce4a6e23-5cde-498d-81e9-367d64fbebf1/4764-2-14re-i4.png" /></p></div>
