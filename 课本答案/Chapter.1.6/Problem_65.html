<div class="answer"> <p>4764-1.6-65P AID: 124</p> <p> RID: 175 | 3/12/12</p> <p> </p> <p>Suppose <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/e89/e8986fca-26af-46ec-95f0-f779e1ee4622/4764-1.6-65p-i1.png" />the set of lower triangular matrices of square order <i>m</i> having 1’s on the diagonal.</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/f3c/f3c5fc04-8a5a-4660-8d60-359fd99f230d/4764-1.6-65p-i2.png" /> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/e6b/e6bfd804-9fd0-41a1-9db9-3e076e636498/4764-1.6-65p-i3.png" />=<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/71d/71df6a9a-a941-4c7f-9cb4-29386f4a105d/4764-1.6-65p-i4.png" /></p> <p>This shows that the product of lower triangular matrices of order <i>m</i> is a lower triangular matrix of order <i>m</i>.</p> <p>Inverse of <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/d74/d7460cfd-4c33-45a6-94d9-3474e1e2263e/4764-1.6-65p-i5.png" /> is <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/899/89923bc6-238b-4aa2-a71f-2509e449c6bb/4764-1.6-65p-i6.png" />which is also a lower triangular matrix having 1’s on the main diagonal. </p> <p>Further, the identity matrix is also a lower triangular matrix.</p> <p>Associativity of product of lower triangular matrices is lower triangular.</p> <p>Using all these properties, we see that the set of all square lower triangular matrices of order <i>m</i> form a group.</p> <p> </p> <p>We observe that <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/e2d/e2de1bf3-c28b-4543-927f-3b5ec1141917/4764-1.6-65p-i7.png" />the diagonal invertible matrices have no diagonal entry 0</p> <p>So, the product of such matrices is also a diagonal matrix having no diagonal entry 0.</p> <p>Therefore, closure law holds under multiplication of matrices</p> <p>Associativity of matrix multiplication holds for any matrices.</p> <p>Already it is given that <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/84c/84cda319-5e3f-4633-8943-5bc18d9143cd/4764-1.6-65p-i8.png" />is invertible and the inverse matrix is also a diagonal matrix having no entry zero on the main diagonal.</p> <p>We easily see that the identity matrix of order <i>m</i> is also a diagonal matrix having no entry 0 on the main diagonal.<i> </i></p> <p>Therefore, <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/bac/bacfe2fa-d75b-4727-b5a5-1003e9cdc352/4764-1.6-65p-i9.png" />is a group under multiplication of matrices.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Symmetric matrices is not a Group</p> <p>Let us consider the symmetric matrices <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/3f2/3f2aa78d-c80c-4296-ad16-ad47976d509a/4764-1.6-65p-i10.png" /></p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/d0e/d0efae0c-e199-4f40-821a-6c1a6f92ae46/4764-1.6-65p-i11.png" /> </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/0da/0da97386-f069-41f6-be55-84fd5ea72c52/4764-1.6-65p-i12.png" />is not a symmetry matrix.</p> <p>That is the product of symmetric matrices does not obey closure law.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>A positive matrix is a square matrix with all eigen values positive.</p> <p>Their product is also a positive matrix, inverse of a positive matrix is positive and identity matrix is a positive matrix and associativity under multiplication holds.</p> <p>Therefore, the set of positive matrices form a group.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The product of permutation matrix is a square matrix with each row has only one entry 1 and other entries zero, similarly with columns.</p> <p>The product of permutation matrices is a permutation matrix and the inverse of a permutation matrix is a permutation matrix.</p> <p>Therefore, the permutation matrices form a group</p> </div>
<h2>Step-5</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Further, the set of matrices of same order, non singular form a group under multiplication of matrices.</p></div>
