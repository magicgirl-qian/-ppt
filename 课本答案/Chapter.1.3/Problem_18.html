<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Consider, a system of linear equations to have exactly two solutions.</p> <p>The objective is to give the correct reason of the following conditions.</p> <p>(a) </p> <p>Consider the points <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/b82/b8270c0c-d74d-48fb-b5a2-056ab7f9814c/4764-1.3-18P-i1.png" />and <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/2ea/2ea6e58a-9401-44fe-bb77-09c9720ab959/4764-1.3-18P-i2.png" />.</p> <p>These two points will create a line, and the solutions would be every single point on that line.</p> <p>Let <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/f17/f17543c3-b0d8-481b-a3f1-6be065bd5ee8/4764-1.3-18P-i3.png" /> and <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/906/90632431-a34b-458a-87cb-4785b6644b49/4764-1.3-18P-i4.png" /> are points that create a line, so the midpoint of <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/744/744191a5-8a35-48f9-b955-a49e10eec836/4764-1.3-18P-i5.png" />will be give an another solution.</p> <p>Thus, the midpoint is,</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/c63/c63dad45-26a3-4167-b461-48b19ae64cf7/4764-1.3-18P-i6.png" /> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>(b) </p> <p>There were the 25 planes meet is the solution of a system of linear equations.</p> <p>So, also here any linear combination of the two points is a solution. Any linear combination of the two points makes a line going through the two points.</p> <p>Therefore, the 25 planes meet everywhere on the line going through the two points.</p></div>
