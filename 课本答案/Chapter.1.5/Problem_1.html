<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The objective is to determine when an upper triangular matrix is nonsingular.</p> <p>Let <i><img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/d6c/d6cee6f3-dc2a-4986-b734-8c2df5de68d1/4764-1.5-1P-i1.png" /></i><i> </i> be an upper triangular matrix.</p> <p>Then, all the entries below the main diagonal are zeros.</p> <p>A matrix <i>A</i> is nonsingular if its determinant is not equal to zero.</p> <p>For any <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/482/482dab41-54ac-4ca8-b53f-b9512be105b8/4764-1.5-1P-i2.png" /> triangular matrix, the determinant is the product of the diagonal entries.</p> <p>Therefore, the determinant of <i>U</i> is the product of all the elements in the main diagonal and it is not equal to zero only if all the diagonal entries are nonzero.</p> <p>That is, the diagonal entries <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/85e/85e3b9b0-1c9b-4480-bb01-ce94a8f112f6/4764-1.5-1P-i3.png" /> must be all nonzero.</p> <p>Hence, an upper triangular matrix is nonsingular if all the diagonal entries of the matrix are nonzero.</p></div>
