<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Each elementary row matrix is a lower triangular matrix.</p> <p>An elementary row matrix is obtained by applying the same elementary row operation that was applied on <i>A</i> is applied on the identity matrix.</p> <p>The inverse of the elementary matrix is also elementary and a lower triangular matrix.</p> <p>Product of lower triangular matrices is also a lower triangular matrix.</p> <p>Thus, the given matrix has become the product of lower and upper triangular matrices.</p> <p>The above procedure is exhibited as;</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/282/2821e6f2-9abb-4fab-9ab2-6254c106173d/4764-1.5-12P-i1.png" /></p> <p>Where<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/a29/a29499f5-bb47-4a80-a000-abfbb955acb9/4764-1.5-12P-i2.png" />â€™s are elementary row matrices and <i><img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/404/404feff3-7ec1-42eb-abbe-44347163daa1/4764-1.5-12P-i3.png" /></i> is the echelon form.</p> <p>Thus,</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/9e0/9e030158-e79e-4728-826a-b3246c22f31e/4764-1.5-12P-i4.png" /></p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Now write the given matrix <i>A</i> as the product of upper and lower triangular matrices.</p> <p>So, start to make zero the entries above the principal diagonal.</p> <p>For this procedure, use the elementary column operations result in elementary column matrices.</p> <p>Apply an elementary column operation on <i>A</i> is nothing but post multiplying <i>A</i> with an elementary column matrix.</p> <p>Each elementary column matrix is an upper triangular matrix.</p> <p>Inverse of an elementary column matrix is also an elementary column matrix.</p> <p> Product of upper triangular matrices is also an upper triangular matrix.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Thus, write the given matrix as the product of upper and lower triangular matrices.</p> <p>The above procedure is performed as; </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/2ae/2ae8451d-809f-4f0d-abaf-a887dfb6517d/4764-1.5-12P-i5.png" /> </p> <p>Where each <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/240/240a5cf9-3a0c-455b-97da-8299a0efb0eb/4764-1.5-12P-i6.png" />is the post multiplied elementary column matrix with <i>A</i> and ultimately, it is reduced to the lower triangular matrix.</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/fad/fadacbf6-4395-4454-bd4e-8459585806fd/4764-1.5-12P-i7.png" /></p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Observe that the entire procedure used in this case and the previous case is different. So, the triangularisations are also different.</p> <p>That is, </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/997/997431b1-fe9e-44e1-a79e-26a3d6760327/4764-1.5-12P-i8.png" />And <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/abb/abb77d0c-1ac9-498a-8442-8eddaf57c36b/4764-1.5-12P-i9.png" /> but <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/c7a/c7a86bd5-39a0-4e96-a3b7-c3e92ce78514/4764-1.5-12P-i10.png" /></p></div>
